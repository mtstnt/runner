# Runner (temp name)
Isolated code runner. Utilized for cross platform deployment.

Main feature:
- Ability to run untrusted code with isolation in several ways -- e.g: Docker Containers, cgroups, etc -- while also able to monitor its resource usage.

Features todo:
- Format output from logs to process further.
- Create a timer builder to build custom runCommands, prescripts, etc.
- Refactor code :)
